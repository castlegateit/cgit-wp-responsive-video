# Castlegate IT WP Responsive Video #

This plugin adjusts the HTML embed code generated by WordPress when inserting embedded media into a post via pasting a YouTube, Vimeo or other service URL.

The media service is detected and service specific markup is returned for each embed, removing the height and width attributes usually included with embed code.

The plugin wraps the embedded media in a container and styles it to maintain the media's aspect ratio, whilst keeping it 100% width.

## Usage

Simply activate the plugin, and any media embedded in posts will be displayed responsively on front end pages.
